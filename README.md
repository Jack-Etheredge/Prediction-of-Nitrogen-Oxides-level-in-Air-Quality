# Predication of level of Nitrogen Oxides in Air

This project aims to predict a level of Nitrogen Oxcides in Air. Data acquired from UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find all information about Dataset from here [Air Quality Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality).

Build a prediction model using linear regression with data cleaning and wrangling, and exploratory data analysis with visualization.
After analyzing the data, some facts came up to know:
* Poisonous gases like CO, NOx are increased in the air over time which also affects one's health.
* During the day Oxides of Nitrogen level increase because of high use of transportation, industries, electrics, etc


## Project Fiels:

* **AirQualityUCI.csv** - Orginal Air Quality Dataset
* **Air Quality UCI Regression.ipynb** - It contains Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis, and Regression Model
