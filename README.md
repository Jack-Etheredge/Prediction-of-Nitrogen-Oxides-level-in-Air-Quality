# Prediction of Nitrogen Oxides level in Air

This project aims to predict the level of Nitrogen Oxides in Air. The data was acquired from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find all the information about Dataset from here [Air Quality Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality).

Created a prediction model using linear regression with data cleaning and wrangling, and exploratory data analysis with visualization.
Analysis of the data shows following findings:
* Poisonous gases like CO, NOx are increased in the air over time which also affects one's health.
* During the day Oxides of Nitrogen level increase because of high use of transportation, industries, electrics, etc
